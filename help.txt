First, navigate to the src directory of the project.
The path should look something like: .../group_0533/phase1/src

Then, run the following commands:
javac */*/*/*.java
javac Application/Main.java
java -cp .:lib/junit.jar:lib/junit-4.12.jar Application.Main

We realize that the use of asterisks in the above command isn't great practice, but since we utilize pop-ups in our
system which aren't directly connection to Application.Main, this was the only command that compiled all java classes
correctly.
